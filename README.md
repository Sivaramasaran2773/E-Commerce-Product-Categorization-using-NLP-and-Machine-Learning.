# E-Commerce-Product-Categorization-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning.
This repository classifies e-commerce products using NLP and ML. The process involves text normalization, vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, word2Vec, fastText, BERT), and classification (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost). It handles four categories: Electronics, Household, Books, and Clothing &amp; Accessories.

## Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of e-commerce necessitates efficient product classification to improve user experience and inventory management. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify e-commerce products based on their descriptions, enhancing accuracy and scalability in the categorization process.
